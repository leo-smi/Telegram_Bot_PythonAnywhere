# Telegram Bot PythonAnywheree
How to make a Telegram bot and deploy in PythonAnywhere

Pyhonanywhere have a free python code project deploy plan, so I decide to make a Telegram bot.

Pythonanywhere free accounts blocks requests that is out of the whitelist, keep in your mind to see the list here: https://www.pythonanywhere.com/whitelist/ there's many API allowed, in this code I use some to test de whitelist.

Enjoy!
